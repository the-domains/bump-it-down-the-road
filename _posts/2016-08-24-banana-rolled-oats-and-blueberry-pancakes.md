### Ingredients (serves 2):

* 1 cup rolled oats
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 200 ml yogurt
* 2 ripe bananas (1 for the batter and 1 for topping)
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
* 1,5 cup blueberries (use half for the batter and half for topping)
* Some (dark) chocolate, crumbled for topping.

Toss all the ingredients (except the ones for the topping of course) in the blender or magimix en blend until the batter is smooth. Bake the pancakes in some oil. Serve with all the toppings and some maple syrup.
