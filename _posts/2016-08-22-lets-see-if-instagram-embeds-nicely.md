# Embed content

Let's see if Instagram embeds nicely.

I first added embed code with a code element. That didn't work, but using the link of a Instagram post did get som result. The link was parsed nicely, but the image got used as a backgroud to the post, making it hard to see it.

**Update: **the layout of the post changed, adding the image in a circle with a color filter. Not sure if I like it that way, but it is interesting to see the format changing.
